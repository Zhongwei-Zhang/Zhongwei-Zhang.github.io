Welcome to my website!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Institute of Statistics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). 
Prior to KIT, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Sebastian Engelke](http://www.sengelke.com/)'s group in the Research Institute for Statistics and Information Science at the University of Geneva for two years. 
I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics under the supervision of [RaphaÃ«l Huser](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/profiles/raphael-huser) from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, a M.Sc. in Mathematics at the Technical University of Munich, and a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Sichuan University.

My research interest centers around modeling and prediction of extreme events using statistical and machine learning models. Recently I am particularly interested in developing statistically sound methodologies for evaluating predictions of extremes, and investigating whether artificial intelligence (AI)-based models can predict extreme weather events and how to improve the reliability/ability of their predictions.

## News

  * Aug. 2025: Our paper entitled "Numerical models outperform AI weather forecasts of record-breaking extremes" is on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15724) (joint work with Erich Fischer, Jakob Zscheischler, and Sebastian Engelke). See the reactions and comments on this preprint on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7364580367900491776/).
  * Jun. 2025: I have presented a poster on AI weather forecasts of record-breaking extremes in the [EXCLAIM symposium](https://exclaim-symposium.ethz.ch/about/symposium.html) at ETH Zurich. Thanks for all the discussions. The poster can be downloaded [here](https://zhongwei-zhang.github.io/files/Poster_EXCLAIM_Jun2025_ZhongweiZhang.pdf).

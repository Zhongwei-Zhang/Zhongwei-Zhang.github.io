Welcome to my website!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Institute of Statistics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). 
Prior to KIT, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in Sebastian Engelke's group in the Research Institute for Statistics and Information Science at the University of Geneva for two years. 
I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics under the supervision of [RaphaÃ«l Huser](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/profiles/raphael-huser) from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, a M.Sc. in Mathematics at the Technical University of Munich, and a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Sichuan University.

My research interest centers around modeling and prediction of extremes. Recently I am particularly interested in developing statistically sound methodologies for evaluating predictions of extremes, and investigating whether artificial intelligence (AI)-based models can predict extreme weather events and how to improve the reliability/ability of these models' prediction of extremes.
